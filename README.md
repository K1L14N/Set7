# Set7
A funny mobile game that requires speed lookout and fast memory.

## Technologies
**[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com)** - **[Angular](https://angular.io)**

## Features
* You can play with the same base ground with a friend by specifying the same **seed**.
* Your score is registered locally and accessible in the *board* tab.

## Rules
The goal of the game is to make the most number of **sets** within the timer. A set is a clustering of three cards.

Each card has four characteristics:
* Their amount (1, 2 or 3)
* Their filling (full, hatched or empty)
* Their color (blue, red or green)
* Their shape (oval, rectangular or diamond)


**To do a set you need to group three cards together so they specify a certain *condition*:**

For each characteristics, either they all **match** or either they are all **different**. 

For instance a good set would be (see screenshots section):

**<1 hatched red oval> - <2 full blue diamond> - <3 empty green rectangular>**

Because their *amount* are all different, their *filling* all different, their *color* all different and *shape* as well.
If you somehow have trouble finding a set, you can click the red button that would show you one. However, this would reset your set counter visible at the top left of the application.
